              <p className="text-justify">
                Indira Kalugalla was born in Pinnawala, Rambukkana, into a
                family deeply rooted in public service and political engagement.
                Growing up in a home where politics and social issues were
                frequently discussed, Indira developed a keen interest in public
                service from a young age. Her early experiences were shaped by
                observing her father's dedication to his duties and her mother's
                commitment to justice and advocacy.

              <p className="pr-16 text-justify">
                Indira's father, Punchi Banda Gunathilleke Kalugalla, was a
                distinguished politician, Cabinet Minister, and diplomat. His
                career included significant roles such as Minister of Finance,
                Minister of Education & Cultural Affairs, and Minister of
                Shipping & Tourism. His unwavering dedication to public service
                and his significant contributions to the political and social
                landscape of Sri Lanka left an indelible mark on the nation and
                profoundly influenced Indira’s values and aspirations. Indira’s
                mother, Thilaka Natha Kalugalla, was a respected lawyer, whose
                career in law provided Indira with a strong sense of ethics,
                integrity, and a deep understanding of legal frameworks. This
                familial environment, rich in legal and political discourse,
                nurtured Indira’s interest in governance and public
                administration from a young age.

                holistic development programs. Although she does not hold formal
                degrees, she mastered the art of administration through
                practical experience, serving as a coordinating private
                secretary to her father and later as a hostess when he served as
                a high commissioner. These experiences equipped her with
                invaluable insights into public administration and governance.
